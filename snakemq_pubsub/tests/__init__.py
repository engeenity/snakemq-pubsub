    These tests take far longer to run than they should, apologies
    for that. Travis CI requires some longer wait times for things
    to pass.

    In an actual production setting it's unlikely one
    process would control a broker, publisher, and subscriber
    together. Don't take these tests as a good example of how
    things should be done.
